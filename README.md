# library-app [view live]()

This is a library app that I created as a project for [Coderhouse](https://www.coderhouse.com.pe/).

- A form that allows user to add new books.
- A delete function.
- Prevents the user from submitting empty fields.
- Stores information about added books in an array.
- Displays the books added by the user in a list on the HTML page.

Changes for Final Version:

- Books from API will be loaded when the list is empty as default.
- Books from API wont be saved, all data will be loaded just from local storage.
- Sweetalert added instead of html alerts.
